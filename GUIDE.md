# Elastic Beanstalk with HTTPS Quick Start Guide

> This document assumes you have an **working** Elastic Beanstalk environment that supports `HTTPS`.  *Tested using the Sample application.*
>
> A working setup *typically* includes a domain, `CNAME` record, [certificate](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/), [ELB environment](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), [`HTTPS` listener](ELB.md), and the *appropiate* ELB/RDS [security group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/#SecurityGroups) rules.

### Starting from Scratch

```sh
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-project
cd my-project
composer require poing/laravel-elb
php artisan elb:install
php artisan elb:publish; # optional

git init
git add .
git commit -am "Initial Commit"

eb init
eb use elb-environment
eb setenv APP_KEY= APP_NAME= DB_HOST= DB_DATABASE= DB_USERNAME= DB_PASSWORD=
eb deploy
```

`psr-4` autoload *-and-* automatic registration of the `ServiceProvider` handles loading the middleware *automatically*.  

*No additional steps are necessary.  **Except** on the [Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-elb.html) side.*
